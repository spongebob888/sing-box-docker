* Introduction
This is a repository of sing-box and naiveproxy docker configuration template.


* Inbounds

** vmess + websocket + tls
This inbound is reverse proxied by caddy and it supports CDN forward.

*** Configuration

   1. Change the *uuid* in this configuration. How to generate uuid? [[https://www.uuidgenerator.net/][click here]].

   2. Change the domain name *websocket.yourserver.com* in =./caddy/Caddyfile= to your own domain. No domain name? Go to [[https://www.freenom.com][Freenom]].

   3. (*Optional*) Change the websocket path in =./sing-box/sing-box.json= and =./caddy/Caddyfile=.


** vmess + http2 + tls

This inbound is reverse proxied by caddy.

*** Configuration

   1. Change the *uuid* in this configuration. How to generate uuid? [[https://www.uuidgenerator.net/][click here]].

   2. Change the domain name *h2.yourserver.com* in =./caddy/Caddyfile= to your own domain. No domain name? Go to [[https://www.freenom.com][Freenom]].

   3. (*Optional*) Change the http2 path in =./sing-box/sing-box.json= and =./caddy/Caddyfile=.

** vmess + grpc + tls

This inbound is reverse proxied by caddy and it supports CDN forward (Cloudflare).

*** Configuration

   1. Change the *uuid* in this configuration. How to generate uuid? [[https://www.uuidgenerator.net/][click here]].

   2. Change the domain name *grpc.yourserver.com* in =./caddy/Caddyfile= to your own domain. No domain name? Go to [[https://www.freenom.com][Freenom]].

   3. (*Optional*) Change the service_name in =./sing-box/sing-box.json= and =./caddy/Caddyfile=.


** naiveproxy
 Naiveproxy is provided by caddy (with naiveproxy plugin). But its traffic is forwarded to sing-box socks inbound to
 route the traffic in order to unlock the netflix and hbomax.

*** Configuration

   1. Change the username and password in the naiveproxy inbound in the =./caddy/Caddyfile=.

** vmess + http3(quic)

  This inbound is *not* reverse proxied by caddy. According to my test, it works in sing-box client but failed for v2ray or xray client.

*** Configuration

    1. Change the *uuid* in this configuration. How to generate uuid? [[https://www.uuidgenerator.net/][click here]].

    2. Set the certificate and key path in the =./sing-box/sing-box.json= to the certificate genereated by caddy. It locates
       in =./caddy/caddy_cert/=. Notice that it needs time to generate a certificate for caddy in the fisrt time run.

** shadowsocks + shadowtls

  This inbound is directly handled by sing-box and is independent from caddy.

*** Configuration

    1. Change the password in the configuration file =./sing-box/sing-box.json=. You can use openssl to generate a
       random password by command =openssl rand -base64 15=
    2. Change the handshake server =microsoft.com= to a legal domain name in your country.

* Outbounds

  There are two outbounds here. One is for direct connection. The other is forwarded by cloudflare warp.
  If you do not need cloudflare outbound, delete the rules in the sing-box configuration file =./sing-box/sing-box.json=.

  For China users it is recommended to block all the traffic back to China.

** Cloudflare Warp Configuration.

   1. Install cloudflare warp client. [[https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/get-started/linux/][Check here!]]

   2. Set the warp to proxy mode by command  =warp-cli set-mode proxy=

   3. Start warp by =warp-cli register= and =warp-cli connect=

   4. Check whether the Netflix is unlocked. If not reconnect the warp until it get unlocked. Reconnect can by done
      througe =warp-cli disconnect= and =warp-cli connect=
